Hue Explorer is a web based tool to help you explore the data in your Philips Hue bridge. These are what you can do with the current version (0.3.0):

1.  Discover and connect to local Hue bridges.
2.  See all data from the bridge in JSON format.
3.  Support remote (out of home) control of the bridge.
4.  Render color values as corresponding colors on screen.

Here are the things I plan for future versions:

1.  Visualize data in a more meaningful way, for example:
2.  Link data between different views, like show light names instead of light ids in a room.
3.  Enable editing of certain data.

If you want to use it without deploying the code, you can visit [https://hueexplorer.app/](https://hueexplorer.app/).
